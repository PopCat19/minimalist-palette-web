I'm too lazy to use figma to configure/export palettes, so I vibe coded this webui with Gemini 2.5 Pro. 

It's fairly configurable and it exports as `png` using an external api, but the resolution would be the same as screenshotting the viewport instead.

I need to stop falling into rabbit holes like this...
